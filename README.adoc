# Student Learning Platform 
This is a student learning platform created by Kalama Kiefer
The platform was created using vaadin, springboot, and java
On the platform students can:
 - log in using their schools authentication as this is a plug in.
 - Students can then create flashcard decks that are stored in the h2 database.
 - Using the flashcard sets students can play a quiz game with the vocabulary they entered
